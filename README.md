# **Enmon Technologies Inventory Meters** üü©

Welcome to the Enmon Technologies full-stack homework project! This React application is designed to:

- Enable users to log in securely by entering email and password credentials.
- Present a user-friendly table displaying a list of meters after a successful login.
- Display at least 5 meter attributes in a table with appropriate formatting.
- Support pagination and sorting functionalities in the meter table (Sorted and Paginated on the client for faster results).
- Implement a REST PUT endpoint for the InventoryMeter entity, empowering users to edit displayed parameters.
- Provide a straightforward logout feature for users.
- Encourage best practices such as TypeScript usage, a thoughtful file organization hierarchy, and adherence to the DRY principle.
- Offer flexibility for developers to choose their preferred component library and state management strategy.
- Prioritize app maintainability and extensibility for future enhancements.
